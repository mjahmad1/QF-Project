    <h2>What is the project about?</h2>
    <p>
        This is a summary of the Qur'an Project's Million Copies Print Appeal, an initiative that aims to print and distribute one million copies of the Qur'an with Bangla and English translations to non-Muslims worldwide. The project seeks to raise £5,000,000 in 90 days.

    <!-- Importance of the project -->
    <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
    <p>
        It's wonderful to see such a dedicated effort towards promoting religious education and fostering interfaith dialogue. The fact that a donation of just £5 can cover the cost of one book and that the project operates on a 100% donation policy is truly commendable. This ensures that every contribution directly supports the cause, making each donation impactful.
